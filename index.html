    <h1>Crux – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: December 5, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how Crux (the “App”) handles information when you use it.
      The App is developed and provided by <strong>Brandon Duarte</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Crux is a climbing route documentation app. It allows you to create and manage climbs,
      attach photos, add notes, tags, grades, and visual annotations. The App is designed to work
      primarily <strong>on your device</strong>. We do not run our own servers for the App, do not
      require an account, and do not use third-party analytics SDKs.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Information You Create in the App</h3>
    <p>
      All content you create or import into the App is stored locally on your device. This may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Climb details (titles, grades, ratings, timestamps)</li>
      <li>Photos you choose from your library or take with your camera</li>
      <li>Annotations on photos (hold markers, beta sequences, and related metadata)</li>
      <li>Tags, notes, and other text you enter</li>
      <li>Send logs and status information you choose to record</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Device and OS-Level Data</h3>
    <p>
      We do not intentionally collect device identifiers, location data, or other personal information.
      However, Apple may provide us with anonymized and aggregated information (for example, crash logs
      or basic usage statistics) through App Store Connect and related developer tools. This information
      does not identify you personally and is used only to improve app stability and performance.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How Your Information Is Stored</h2>
    <p>
      All app data is stored locally on your device using Apple’s system storage mechanisms
      (for example, SwiftData). We do not run our own backend or database for this App.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because storage is local:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your data is tied to your device and your iOS backup settings.</li>
      <li>If you uninstall the App, iOS will delete the App’s local data.</li>
      <li>If you enable iCloud backups, Apple may back up the App’s data as part of your device backup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We use your information solely for the operation of the App, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Displaying your climbs, photos, tags, notes, and annotations</li>
      <li>Allowing you to search, filter, and organize your climbs</li>
      <li>Improving app reliability using anonymized crash and performance data provided by Apple</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> use your information for targeted advertising, user profiling,
      or cross-app tracking.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal data with third parties.
      Your data may be shared only when:
    </p>
    <p>
      Apple and other platform providers (such as iCloud, if enabled) may process your
      data in accordance with their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We rely on Apple’s operating system and security features to protect the data stored on your device.
      You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and your Apple ID, including enabling
      features such as device passcodes, Face ID/Touch ID, and iCloud security options.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your data only as long as it remains on your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can delete individual climbs, notes, and photos from within the App.</li>
      <li>You can delete all App data by uninstalling the App from your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children under 13. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information,
      please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Because we do not operate our own user accounts or remote servers for this App, most control over your
      data is exercised directly on your device (for example, by editing or deleting climbs, or uninstalling
      the App). If you have questions about how your data is handled, you may contact us using the information below.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App or applicable laws.
      When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the
      App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the App’s data practices, please contact:
